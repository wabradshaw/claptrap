# Claptrap
A joke telling AI that frequently misses the mark. At least, I assume it will. It's not written yet.

# Thanks
This project wouldn't exist without the help of a few people, despite the fact they don't know it exists. Firstly, I'd like to thank Kim Binsted, Graeme Ritchie and Helen Pain. Their work on JAPE (Joking Analysis and Production Engine) and STANDUP / the Joking Computer served as the basis for this design. In particular Helen was my advisor for my first foray into computational humour. She introduced me to the STANDUP system, gave me the opportunity to work with it, then put up with months of me complaining about the quality of the jokes. Thanks also to the whole team behind STANDUP / the Joking Computer, it might have been Kim & Graeme's brainchild, but it wouldn't have got where it did without all of the researchers in Edinburgh & Aberdeen.

Finally, I'd like to thank the Datamuse, WordNet and the CMU pronunciation dictionary. They supply the data that Claptrap uses to tell jokes.
